  ❌ Critical Issues:
  [All critical issues have been FIXED ✅]

  ⚠️ Functional Issues:

  9. No Task Movement - Can't move tasks between stories/epics
  10. Missing Bulk Operations - No bulk delete/update for hierarchy items

  FIXED ✅:
  6. Incomplete Data Structure - FIXED: StoryWithTaskDto now supports subtasks for all levels
  7. Manual Progress Updates - FIXED: Automatic weighted progress calculation with event-driven updates
  8. Type Inconsistency - FIXED: Endpoints now auto-set type and parentId correctly

  🐛 Technical Issues:

  13. Weak Validation - No circular reference checks for parent-child relationships
  15. Mixed Return Types - Some methods return Long, others Integer for sort order

  FIXED ✅:
  11. N+1 Query Risk - FIXED: Optimized with bulk loading, 1-2 queries instead of N queries
  12. Missing Transaction Boundaries - FIXED: Added @Transactional annotations
  14. Error Message Typos - FIXED: Corrected "Expected EPIC" messages

  🔧 API Design Issues:

  18. No Pagination - Large hierarchies could overwhelm responses
  19. Missing Validation Annotations - @Valid missing on some request bodies
  20. Poor HTTP Status Codes - All responses use 200/201, missing 404, 400 variants

  FIXED ✅:
  16. Inconsistent Naming - FIXED: Updated to /epic/uuid/{epicUuid}/hierarchy endpoint
  17. Missing Resource Identifiers - FIXED: Added UUID support with getFullHierarchyByUuid method

  📊 Data Completeness Issues:

  21. Missing Task Counts - No progress/completion statistics in responses
  23. Missing Sort Orders - Tasks not ordered properly in responses
  24. No Task Dependencies - Can't define task prerequisites within stories

  FIXED ✅:
  22. No Parent References - FIXED: TaskResponse now includes parentTaskId and parentTaskTitle

  🔒 Security Issues:

  25. No Ownership Checks - Missing validation that user owns the epic/story/task
  26. No Workspace Isolation - Tasks could leak between workspaces

  Priority Classification:

  - P0 (Blocker): FIXED ✅ - All critical issues resolved
  - P1 (High): Issues 9, 10, 21 (6 resolved: 7, 8, 6, 22, 16, 17)

  - P3 (Low): Issues 25, 26

  Total Issues: 26 → 12 remaining (14 FIXED ✅)
